# Code Organization Summary

## Overview
The code has been successfully separated from a single `MainActivity.kt` file into multiple organized files for better maintainability and structure.

## New File Structure

### 📁 **screens/** - Individual Screen Components
- **`LoginScreen.kt`** - Login screen with authentication form
- **`SignupScreen.kt`** - User registration screen  
- **`HomeScreen.kt`** - Main home screen with user info
- **`AlertScreen.kt`** - Alerts and notifications screen
- **`AwarenessScreen.kt`** - Health awareness and tips screen
- **`ReportIssueScreen.kt`** - Issue reporting screen
- **`MainScreen.kt`** - Main container with navigation logic

### 📁 **navigation/** - Navigation Components
- **`BottomNavigation.kt`** - Custom bottom navigation bar

### 📁 **MainActivity.kt** - Main Entry Point
- Now only contains the main activity logic
- Imports and calls all screen components
- Handles screen switching between login/signup/main

## Benefits of This Structure

### ✅ **Better Organization**
- Each screen has its own file
- Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ **Improved Maintainability**
- Changes to one screen don't affect others
- Easier to debug specific issues
- Better code readability

### ✅ **Team Development**
- Multiple developers can work on different screens
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear ownership of components

### ✅ **Scalability**
- Easy to add new screens
- Simple to modify navigation
- Better for larger applications

## How Navigation Works

1. **MainActivity** manages the main screen state (`login`, `signup`, `main`)
2. **MainScreen** handles the bottom navigation between different tabs
3. **BottomNavigation** component provides the navigation UI
4. Each individual screen is a separate composable function

## File Dependencies

```
MainActivity.kt
├── LoginScreen.kt
├── SignupScreen.kt
└── MainScreen.kt
    ├── HomeScreen.kt
    ├── AlertScreen.kt
    ├── AwarenessScreen.kt
    ├── ReportIssueScreen.kt
    ├── ProfileScreen.kt
    └── BottomNavigation.kt
```

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. **Add Navigation Compose** for more professional navigation
2. **Create ViewModels** for each screen for better state management
3. **Add Repository pattern** for data management
4. **Implement proper error handling** across all screens
5. **Add unit tests** for individual components

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Code separation into individual files
✅ **COMPLETED**: Navigation structure maintained
✅ **COMPLETED**: All functionality preserved
✅ **COMPLETED**: Clean imports and dependencies

The app now has a professional, maintainable structure while preserving all existing functionality!
