# Sticky Header Implementation

## Problem
Users had to scroll back to the top of the Settings, Help & Support, and About screens to access the back button, which was poor UX.

## Solution
Implemented sticky headers that remain fixed at the top of the screen while content scrolls underneath, providing constant access to navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. SettingsScreen.kt
- **Before**: Header was part of the scrollable content
- **After**: Header is now a sticky Surface with shadow elevation
- **Structure**: 
  - Sticky header with back button and "Settings" title
  - Scrollable content below with all settings sections

### 2. HelpSupportScreen.kt
- **Before**: Header was part of the scrollable content
- **After**: Header is now a sticky Surface with shadow elevation
- **Structure**:
  - Sticky header with back button and "Help & Support" title
  - Scrollable content below with Quick Actions, FAQ, and Contact sections

### 3. AboutScreen.kt
- **Before**: Header was part of the scrollable content
- **After**: Header is now a sticky Surface with shadow elevation
- **Structure**:
  - Sticky header with back button and "About" title
  - Scrollable content below with app info, developer info, and statistics

## Technical Implementation

### Layout Structure
```kotlin
Column(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
    // Sticky Header
    Surface(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
        color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surface,
        shadowElevation = 4.dp
    ) {
        Row(
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxWidth()
                .padding(16.dp),
            verticalAlignment = Alignment.CenterVertically
        ) {
            IconButton(onClick = onBackPressed) { /* Back button */ }
            Spacer(modifier = Modifier.width(8.dp))
            Text(text = "Page Title") // Page title
        }
    }
    
    // Scrollable Content
    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(16.dp)
            .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())
    ) {
        // All page content here
    }
}
```

### Key Features
- **Sticky Header**: Surface with shadow elevation that stays at the top
- **Scrollable Content**: Content below the header scrolls independently
- **Consistent Design**: All three pages follow the same pattern
- **Material Design**: Uses proper elevation and surface colors

## Benefits

### ✅ **Improved UX**
- Users can always access the back button without scrolling
- Clear visual separation between header and content
- Consistent navigation experience across all pages

### ✅ **Visual Design**
- Header has subtle shadow for depth
- Proper Material Design 3 implementation
- Maintains theme consistency (works with dark mode)

### ✅ **Performance**
- No performance impact from the sticky header
- Smooth scrolling experience
- Efficient layout structure

## Screens Affected
1. **Settings Screen** - Settings configuration options
2. **Help & Support Screen** - FAQ and contact information
3. **About Screen** - App information and developer details

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
- ✅ Sticky headers remain fixed during scrolling
- ✅ Back button functionality preserved
- ✅ Dark mode compatibility maintained
- ✅ Bottom navigation padding still works correctly

## Future Considerations
- This pattern can be applied to other screens that need sticky headers
- Consider creating a reusable `StickyHeaderScreen` component
- Could add animations for header appearance/disappearance
